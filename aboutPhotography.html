<p><strong> Namastey!</strong> </br></br>        
I'm a <strong>filmmaker, engineer,</strong> and <strong>designer</strong> who thrives at the intersection of storytelling and technology. My passion lies in crafting visually compelling narratives — whether through directing, editing, or collaborating with creative teams to bring ideas to life on screen. </br></br>

With a strong foundation in visual storytelling and a sharp eye for detail, I specialize in <strong>photography, cinematography, video editing,</strong> and <strong>post-production</strong>. I’m skilled in tools like Adobe Light Room, Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve, and I work closely with creative directors to shape stories that resonate.</br></br> My background in UI/UX design and technical project management adds a unique edge to my process, allowing me to bridge the gap between creativity and precision.

Whether I’m behind the camera or shaping the final cut, I’m driven by the power of story — and the craft it takes to tell it well.
